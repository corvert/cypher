# Cyper Tool
## The Cyper Tool functions
The Cypher Tool is a command-line application crafted for encrypting and decrypting messages using diverse ciphers. It enables users to encode plain text for confidentiality or decode ciphered text to restore the original content.

## Usage of the tool with an example

Choose the operation you want to perform: enter **"1"** for encrypt or **"2"** for decrypt and press **enter**.

>
Next you need to choose cryptographic method. Select a cipher by entering **"1"** to ROT13, **"2"** to reverse and **"3"** to ***"func3"*** and push **enter** again.

Now it's time to enter something you want to encrypt or decrypt.

## Cyphers used

![Example 3](images/image-6.png)    
**ROT13** shifts each letter in the alphabet by 13 positions.

**Reverse** cipher reverses the order of characters in a message. 
>
![Example 5](images/image-8.png)    
**fun3** shifts each letter in the alphabet one step forward.
